- Finished NFT Launchpad contracts + Loan Market contracts.

- Researching erc20 launchpad protocols (Lukso: rICO, Sushi: MISO) to start building v2 contracts, similar to the NFT launchpad w/ multiple model selectors (much excite!).
- Began building tutorial game (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8YUfee_pzc). Very refreshing to learn something new.
- Started building DutchAuction contract (erc20 launchpad, nft launchpad models, nft marketplace)

29/12/2021
- Reworked NFT Launchpad after reading MISO's factory + model deployment strategy (uses clones). So, made a factory that uses EIP-1167 cloning system and is catered to adding new models later on.
- Learned some assembly when deploying clones w/ the EIP-1167 clone factory contract. (https://blog.openzeppelin.com/deep-dive-into-the-minimal-proxy-contract/)
- Thinking of applying for OpenZeppelin Security Analyst. Probs will get denied but why not apply (.__.).
